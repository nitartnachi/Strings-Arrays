/*
 Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example, "Red rum, sir, is murder" is a palindrome, while "Programcreek is awesome" is not.

Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
