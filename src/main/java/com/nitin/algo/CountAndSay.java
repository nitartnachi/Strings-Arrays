 The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
	1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
	
	1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
	11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
	21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
	1211 is read off as "one 1, one 2, then two 1" or 111221.
	111221 is read off as "three 1s, two 2s, then one 1" or 1112211
	Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
