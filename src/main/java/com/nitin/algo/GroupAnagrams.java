/*
 Given an array of strings, return all groups of strings that are anagrams.

Analysis

An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, Torchwood can be rearranged into Doctor Who.

If two strings are anagram to each other, their sorted sequence is the same.
